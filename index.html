            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I am Krishanu, a 1st year student at University of Engineering and Management
                Kolkata, doing my bachelor of technology. I am passionate about computer science, biology and
                mathematics, and I am constantly exploring new ways to apply what I learn in the classroom to
                real-world challenges. My academic journey has strengthened my skills in problem solving,
                research and I enjoy engaging in hands-on projects that let me collaborate with others and think
                critically.
                Beyond academics, I also enjoy mountain climbing, playing games and sports. I am always eager
                to learn and grow, whether through internships, volunteer work, or independent study.</p>

            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in technology at University of Engineering and
                Management, with an expected graduation in 2028. My academic journey has provided me with
                a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics, allowing me to further develop my
                critical skills. Since school I had an interest in science and building projects which helped in
                growing my communication and research skills.</p>

            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>Throughout my time at UEM, I have gained diverse experiences that have enriched my
                academic and professional development. I have been involved in events where I’ve learnt about
                developers, I have been involved in financial events and had a lead role in making posters and
                flyers. These experiences helped me develop strong leadership, organizational, and
                collaboration skills. I have also started learning about web and app development on my own due
                to my passion in these subjects.Whether working independently or as part of a team, these
                experiences have sharpened my ability to manage time, solve problems creatively, and
                communicate effectively. I look forward to leveraging these experiences in future professional
                roles and continuing to grow my skills.</p>
